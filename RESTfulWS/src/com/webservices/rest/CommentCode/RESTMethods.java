		7	HEAD	http://localhost:8080/UserManagement/rest/UserService/users	Returns only HTTP Header, no Body.	Read Only
		Here are important points to be considered:

		GET operations are read only and are safe.

		PUT and DELETE operations are idempotent means their result will always same no matter how many times these operations are invoked.

		PUT and POST operation are nearly same with the difference lying only in the result where PUT operation is idempotent and POST operation can cause different result.
